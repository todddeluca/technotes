> sbt-revolver is a plugin for SBT enabling a super-fast development turnaround
> for your Scala applications.
> 
> It sports the following features:
> 
> Starting and stopping your application in the background of your interactive
> SBT shell (in a forked JVM) Triggered restart: automatically restart your
> application as soon as some of its sources have been changed Even though
> sbt-revolver works great with spray on spray-can there is nothing
> spray-specific to it. It can be used with any Scala application as long as
> there is some object with a main method.
